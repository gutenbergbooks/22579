<p class="bigcap">AS a blisteringly hot but
guaranteed weather-controlled
future summer day
dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
the walking mills of Puffy Products
("Spike to Loaf in One
Operation!") began to tread delicately
on their centipede legs
across the wheat fields of Kansas.</p>

<p>The walking mills resembled fat
metal serpents, rather larger than
those Chinese paper dragons animated
by files of men in procession.
Sensory robot devices in
their noses informed them that
the waiting wheat had reached ripe
perfection.</p>

<p>As they advanced, their heads
swung lazily from side to side, very
much like snakes, gobbling the yellow
grain. In their throats, it was
threshed, the chaff bundled and
burped aside for pickup by the
crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
the kernels quick-dried
and blown along into the mighty
chests of the machines. There the
tireless mills ground the kernels
to flour, which was instantly sifted,
the bran being packaged and
dropped like the chaff for pickup.
A cluster of tanks which gave
the metal serpents a decidedly
humpbacked appearance added
water, shortening, salt and other
ingredients, some named and some
not. The dough was at the same
time infused with gas from a tank
conspicuously labeled "Carbon
Dioxide" ("No Yeast Creatures
in Your Bread!").</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/001.png" width="384" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thus instantly risen, the dough
was clipped into loaves and shot
into radionic ovens forming the
midsections of the metal serpents.
There the bread was baked in a
matter of seconds, a fierce heat-front
browning the crusts, and the
piping-hot loaves sealed in transparent
plastic bearing the proud
Puffyloaf emblem (two cherubs
circling a floating loaf) and ejected
onto the delivery platform at each
serpent's rear end, where a cluster
of pickup machines, like hungry
piglets, snatched at the loaves
with hygienic claws.</p>

<p>A few loaves would be hurried
off for the day's consumption,
the majority stored for winter in
strategically located mammoth
deep freezes.</p>

<p>But now, behold a wonder! As
loaves began to appear on the
delivery platform of the first walking
mill to get into action, they
did not linger on the conveyor
belt, but rose gently into the air
and slowly traveled off down-wind
across the hot rippling fields.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">THE robot claws of the pickup
machines clutched in vain, and,
not noticing the difference, proceeded
carefully to stack emptiness,
tier by tier. One errant loaf,
rising more sluggishly than its fellows,
was snagged by a thrusting
claw. The machine paused, clumsily
wiped off the injured loaf, set
it aside&mdash;where it bobbed on one
corner, unable to take off again&mdash;and
went back to the work of
storing nothingness.</p>

<p>A flock of crows rose from the
trees of a nearby shelterbelt as the
flight of loaves approached. The
crows swooped to investigate and
then suddenly scattered, screeching
in panic.</p>

<p>The helicopter of a hangoverish
Sunday traveler bound for Wichita
shied very similarly from the
brown fliers and did not return for
a second look.</p>

<p>A black-haired housewife spied
them over her back fence, crossed
herself and grabbed her walkie-talkie
from the laundry basket.
Seconds later, the yawning correspondent
of a regional newspaper
was jotting down the lead of a humorous
news story which, recalling
the old flying-saucer scares, stated
that now apparently bread was to
be included in the mad aerial tea
party.</p>

<p>The congregation of an open-walled
country church, standing
up to recite the most familiar of
Christian prayers, had just reached
the petition for daily sustenance,
when a sub-flight of the loaves,
either forced down by a vagrant
wind or lacking the natural buoyancy
of the rest, came coasting silently
as the sunbeams between the
graceful pillars at the altar end of
the building.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the main flight, now
augmented by other bread flocks
from scores and hundreds of walking
mills that had started work a
little later, mounted slowly and
majestically into the cirrus-flecked
upper air, where a steady
wind was blowing strongly toward
the east.</p>

<p>About one thousand miles farther
on in that direction, where a cluster
of stratosphere-tickling towers
marked the location of the metropolis
of NewNew York, a tender
scene was being enacted in the
pressurized penthouse managerial
suite of Puffy Products. Megera
Winterly, Secretary in Chief to the
Managerial Board and referred to
by her underlings as the Blonde
Icicle, was dealing with the advances
of Roger ("Racehorse")
Snedden, Assistant Secretary to the
Board and often indistinguishable
from any passing office boy.</p>

<p>"Why don't you jump out the
window, Roger, remembering to
shut the airlock after you?" the
Golden Glacier said in tones not
unkind. "When are your high-strung,
thoroughbred nerves going
to accept the fact that I would
never consider marriage with a
business inferior? You have about
as much chance as a starving
Ukrainian kulak now that Moscow's
clapped on the interdict."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">ROGER'S voice was calm, although
his eyes were feverishly
bright, as he replied, "A lot
of things are going to be different
around here, Meg, as soon as the
Board is forced to admit that only
my quick thinking made it possible
to bring the name of Puffyloaf in
front of the whole world."</p>

<p>"Puffyloaf could do with a little
of that," the business girl observed
judiciously. "The way sales have
been plummeting, it won't be long
before the Government deeds our
desks to the managers of Fairy
Bread and asks us to take the Big
Jump. But just where does your
quick thinking come into this, Mr.
Snedden? You can't be referring to
the helium&mdash;that was Rose Thinker's
brainwave."</p>

<p>She studied him suspiciously.
"You've birthed another promotional
bumble, Roger. I can see it
in your eyes. I only hope it's not
as big a one as when you put the
Martian ambassador on 3D and he
thanked you profusely for the gross
of Puffyloaves, assuring you that
he'd never slept on a softer mattress
in all his life on two planets."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Meg. Today&mdash;yes,
today!&mdash;you're going to see
the Board eating out of my hand."</p>

<p>"Hah! I guarantee you won't
have any fingers left. You're bold
enough now, but when Mr. Gryce
and those two big machines come
through that door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute, Meg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! They're coming now!"</p>

<p>Roger leaped three feet in the
air, but managed to land without a
sound and edged toward his stool.
Through the dilating iris of the
door strode Phineas T. Gryce,
flanked by Rose Thinker and Tin
Philosopher.</p>

<p>The man approached the conference
table in the center of the room
with measured pace and gravely
expressionless face. The rose-tinted
machine on his left did a couple
of impulsive pirouettes on the way
and twittered a greeting to Meg
and Roger. The other machine quietly
took the third of the high seats
and lifted a claw at Meg, who now
occupied a stool twice the height of
Roger's.</p>

<p>"Miss Winterly, please&mdash;our
theme."</p>

<p>The Blonde Icicle's face thawed
into a little-girl smile as she chanted
bubblingly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Made up of tiny wheaten motes</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And reinforced with sturdy oats,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It rises through the air and floats&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The bread on which all Terra dotes!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">"THANK YOU, Miss Winterly,"
said Tin Philosopher.
"Though a purely figurative statement,
that bit about rising through
the air always gets me&mdash;here." He
rapped his midsection, which gave
off a high musical <i>clang</i>.</p>

<p>"Ladies&mdash;" he inclined his photocells
toward Rose Thinker and Meg&mdash;"and
gentlemen. This is a historic
occasion in Old Puffy's long history,
the inauguration of the helium-filled
loaf ('So Light It Almost Floats
Away!') in which that inert and
heaven-aspiring gas replaces old-fashioned
carbon dioxide. Later,
there will be kudos for Rose
Thinker, whose bright relays genius-sparked
the idea, and also for Roger
Snedden, who took care of the
details.</p>

<p>"By the by, Racehorse, that was
a brilliant piece of work getting the
helium out of the government&mdash;they've
been pretty stuffy lately
about their monopoly. But first I
want to throw wide the casement in
your minds that opens on the Long
View of Things."</p>

<p>Rose Thinker spun twice on her
chair and opened her photocells
wide. Tin Philosopher coughed to
limber up the diaphragm of his
speaker and continued:</p>

<p>"Ever since the first cave wife
boasted to her next-den neighbor
about the superior paleness and fluffiness
of her tortillas, mankind has
sought lighter, whiter bread. Indeed,
thinkers wiser than myself have
equated the whole upward course of
culture with this poignant quest.
Yeast was a wonderful discovery&mdash;for
its primitive day. Sifting the
bran and wheat germ from the flour
was an even more important advance.
Early bleaching and preserving
chemicals played their humble
parts.</p>

<p>"For a while, barbarous faddists&mdash;blind
to the deeply spiritual nature
of bread, which is recognized
by all great religions&mdash;held back
our march toward perfection with
their hair-splitting insistence on the
vitamin content of the wheat germ,
but their case collapsed when tasteless
colorless substitutes were
triumphantly synthesized and introduced
into the loaf, which for flawless
purity, unequaled airiness and
sheer intangible goodness was rapidly
becoming mankind's supreme
gustatory experience."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/002.png" width="377" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I wonder what the stuff tastes
like," Rose Thinker said out of a
clear sky.</p>

<p>"I wonder what taste tastes like,"
Tin Philosopher echoed dreamily.
Recovering himself, he continued:</p>

<p>"Then, early in the twenty-first
century, came the epochal researches
of Everett Whitehead,
Puffyloaf chemist, culminating in
his paper 'The Structural Bubble
in Cereal Masses' and making possible
the baking of airtight bread
twenty times stronger (for its
weight) than steel and of a
lightness that would have been
incredible even to the advanced
chemist-bakers of the twentieth
century&mdash;a lightness so great that,
besides forming the backbone of
our own promotion, it has forever
since been capitalized on by our
conscienceless competitors of Fairy
Bread with their enduring slogan:
'It Makes Ghost Toast'."</p>

<p>"That's a beaut, all right, that
ecto-dough blurb," Rose Thinker
admitted, bugging her photocells
sadly. "Wait a sec. How about?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>There'll be bread</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Overhead</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When you're dead&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is said.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">PHINEAS T. GRYCE wrinkled
his nostrils at the pink machine
as if he smelled her insulation
smoldering. He said mildly, "A
somewhat unhappy jingle, Rose,
referring as it does to the end of
the customer as consumer. Moreover,
we shouldn't overplay the
figurative 'rises through the air'
angle. What inspired you?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I don't know&mdash;oh,
yes, I do. I was remembering
one of the workers' songs we machines
used to chant during the Big
Strike&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Work and pray,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Live on hay.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You'll get pie</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In the sky</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When you die&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It's a lie!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I don't know why we chanted
it," she added. "We didn't want pie&mdash;or
hay, for that matter. And
machines don't pray, except Tibetan
prayer wheels."</p>

<p>Phineas T. Gryce shook his head.
"Labor relations are another topic
we should stay far away from.
However, dear Rose, I'm glad you
keep trying to outjingle those dirty
crooks at Fairy Bread." He scowled,
turning back his attention to Tin
Philosopher. "I get whopping mad,
Old Machine, whenever I hear that
other slogan of theirs, the discriminatory
one&mdash;'Untouched by Robot
Claws.' Just because they employ a
few filthy androids in their factories!"</p>

<p>Tin Philosopher lifted one of his
own sets of bright talons. "Thanks,
P.T. But to continue my historical
resume, the next great advance in
the baking art was the substitution
of purified carbon dioxide, recovered
from coal smoke, for the gas
generated by yeast organisms indwelling
in the dough and later
killed by the heat of baking, their
corpses remaining <i>in situ</i>. But even
purified carbon dioxide is itself a
rather repugnant gas, a product of
metabolism whether fast or slow,
and forever associated with those
life processes which are obnoxious
to the fastidious."</p>

<p>Here the machine shuddered
with delicate clinkings. "Therefore,
we of Puffyloaf are taking today
what may be the ultimate step
toward purity: we are aerating our
loaves with the noble gas helium,
an element which remains virginal
in the face of all chemical temptations
and whose slim molecules are
eleven times lighter than obese
carbon dioxide&mdash;yes, noble uncontaminable
helium, which, if it be a
kind of ash, is yet the ash only of
radioactive burning, accomplished
or initiated entirely on the Sun, a
safe 93 million miles from this
planet. Let's have a cheer for the
helium loaf!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">WITHOUT changing expression,
Phineas T. Gryce rapped
the table thrice in solemn applause,
while the others bowed their heads.</p>

<p>"Thanks, T.P.," P.T. then said.
"And now for the Moment of
Truth. Miss Winterly, how is the
helium loaf selling?"</p>

<p>The business girl clapped on a
pair of earphones and whispered
into a lapel mike. Her gaze grew
abstracted as she mentally translated
flurries of brief squawks into
coherent messages. Suddenly a single
vertical furrow creased her
matchlessly smooth brow.</p>

<p>"It isn't, Mr. Gryce!" she gasped
in horror. "Fairy Bread is outselling
Puffyloaves by an infinity factor.
So far this morning, <i>there has
not been one single delivery of
Puffyloaves to any sales spot</i>! Complaints
about non-delivery are pouring
in from both walking stores and
sessile shops."</p>

<p>"Mr. Snedden!" Gryce barked.
"What bug in the new helium
process might account for this
delay?"</p>

<p>Roger was on his feet, looking
bewildered. "I can't imagine, sir,
unless&mdash;just possibly&mdash;there's
been some unforeseeable difficulty
involving the new metal-foil wrappers."</p>

<p>"Metal-foil wrappers? Were <i>you</i>
responsible for those?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Last-minute recalculations
showed that the extra lightness
of the new loaf might be great
enough to cause drift during stackage.
Drafts in stores might topple
sales pyramids. Metal-foil wrappers,
by their added weight, took
care of the difficulty."</p>

<p>"And you ordered them without
consulting the Board?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. There was hardly time
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you fool! I noticed that
order for metal-foil wrappers, assumed
it was some sub-secretary's
mistake, and canceled it last night!"</p>

<p>Roger Snedden turned pale.
"You canceled it?" he quavered.
"And told them to go back to the
lighter plastic wrappers?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Just what is behind
all this, Mr. Snedden? <i>What</i> recalculations
were you trusting, when
our physicists had demonstrated
months ago that the helium loaf
was safely stackable in light airs
and gentle breezes&mdash;winds up to
Beaufort's scale 3. <i>Why</i> should a
change from heavier to lighter
wrappers result in complete non-delivery?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">ROGER Snedden's paleness became
tinged with an interesting
green. He cleared his throat
and made strange gulping noises.
Tin Philosopher's photocells focused
on him calmly, Rose
Thinker's with unfeigned excitement.
P.T. Gryce's frown grew
blacker by the moment, while
Megera Winterly's Venus-mask
showed an odd dawning of dismay
and awe. She was getting new
squawks in her earphones.</p>

<p>"Er ... ah ... er...." Roger
said in winning tones. "Well, you
see, the fact is that I...."</p>

<p>"Hold it," Meg interrupted
crisply. "Triple-urgent from Public
Relations, Safety Division. Tulsa-Topeka
aero-express makes emergency
landing after being buffeted
in encounter with vast flight of
objects first described as brown
birds, although no failures reported
in airway's electronic anti-bird
fences. After grounding safely near
Emporia&mdash;no fatalities&mdash;pilot's
windshield found thinly plastered
with soft white-and-brown material.
Emblems on plastic wrappers embedded
in material identify it incontrovertibly
as an undetermined
number of Puffyloaves cruising at
three thousand feet!"</p>

<p>Eyes and photocells turned inquisitorially
upon Roger Snedden.
He went from green to Puffyloaf
white and blurted: "All right, I did
it, but it was the only way out!
Yesterday morning, due to the
Ukrainian crisis, the government
stopped sales and deliveries of all
strategic stockpiled materials, including
helium gas. Puffy's new
program of advertising and promotion,
based on the lighter loaf, was
already rolling. There was only one
thing to do, there being only one
other gas comparable in lightness
to helium. I diverted the necessary
quantity of hydrogen gas from the
Hydrogenated Oils Section of our
Magna-Margarine Division and
substituted it for the helium."</p>

<p>"You substituted ... hydrogen ... for
the ... helium?" Phineas
T. Gryce faltered in low mechanical
tones, taking four steps backward.</p>

<p>"Hydrogen is twice as light as
helium," Tin Philosopher remarked
judiciously.</p>

<p>"And many times cheaper&mdash;did
you know that?" Roger countered
feebly. "Yes, I substituted hydrogen.
The metal-foil wrapping would
have added just enough weight to
counteract the greater buoyancy of
the hydrogen loaf. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So, when this morning's loaves
began to arrive on the delivery
platforms of the walking mills...."
Tin Philosopher left the remark
unfinished.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Roger agreed dismally.</p>

<p>"Let me ask you, Mr. Snedden,"
Gryce interjected, still in low tones,
"if you expected people to jump to
the kitchen ceiling for their Puffybread
after taking off the metal
wrapper, or reach for the sky if
they happened to unwrap the stuff
outdoors?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gryce," Roger said reproachfully,
"you have often assured
me that what people do with
Puffybread after they buy it is no
concern of ours."</p>

<p>"I seem to recall," Rose Thinker
chirped somewhat unkindly, "that
dictum was created to answer inquiries
after Roger put the famous
sculptures-in-miniature artist on 3D
and he testified that he always
molded his first attempts from
Puffybread, one jumbo loaf squeezing
down to approximately the size
of a peanut."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">HER photocells dimmed and
brightened. "Oh, boy&mdash;hydrogen!
The loaf's unwrapped. After
a while, in spite of the crust-seal, a
little oxygen diffuses in. An explosive
mixture. Housewife in curlers
and kimono pops a couple slices in
the toaster. Boom!"</p>

<p>The three human beings in the
room winced.</p>

<p>Tin Philosopher kicked her under
the table, while observing, "So
you see, Roger, that the non-delivery
of the hydrogen loaf carries
some consolations. And I must confess
that one aspect of the affair
gives me great satisfaction, not as a
Board Member but as a private
machine. You have at last made a
reality of the 'rises through the air'
part of Puffybread's theme. They
can't ever take that away from you.
By now, half the inhabitants of the
Great Plains must have observed
our flying loaves rising high."</p>

<p>Phineas T. Gryce shot a frightened
look at the west windows and
found his full voice.</p>

<p>"Stop the mills!" he roared at
Meg Winterly, who nodded and
whispered urgently into her mike.</p>

<p>"A sensible suggestion," Tin
Philosopher said. "But it comes a
trifle late in the day. If the mills
are still walking and grinding, approximately
seven billion Puffyloaves
are at this moment cruising
eastward over Middle America.
Remember that a six-month supply
for deep-freeze is involved and that
the current consumption of bread,
due to its matchless airiness, is
eight and one-half loaves per person
per day."</p>

<p>Phineas T. Gryce carefully inserted
both hands into his scanty
hair, feeling for a good grip. He
leaned menacingly toward Roger
who, chin resting on the table, regarded
him apathetically.</p>

<p>"Hold it!" Meg called sharply.
"Flock of multiple-urgents coming

Army: Why do loaves flame when

Chicago: Advise on destination of
bread-lift. And some Kansas church
is accusing us of a hoax inciting to
blasphemy, of faking miracles&mdash;I
don't know <i>why</i>."</p>

<p>The business girl tore off her
headphones. "Roger Snedden," she
cried with a hysteria that would
have dumfounded her underlings,
"you've brought the name of Puffyloaf
in front of the whole world, all
right! Now do something about the
situation!"</p>

<p>Roger nodded obediently. But
his pallor increased a shade, the
pupils of his eyes disappeared under
the upper lids, and his head
burrowed beneath his forearms.</p>

<p>"Oh, boy," Rose Thinker called
gayly to Tin Philosopher, "this
looks like the start of a real crisis
session! Did you remember to
bring spare batteries?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">MEANWHILE, the monstrous
flight of Puffyloaves, filling
midwestern skies as no small fliers
had since the days of the passenger
pigeon, soared steadily onward.</p>

<p>Private fliers approached the
brown and glistening bread-front in
curiosity and dipped back in awe.
Aero-expresslines organized sightseeing
flights along the flanks.
Planes of the government forestry
and agricultural services and 'copters
bearing the Puffyloaf emblem
hovered on the fringes, watching
developments and waiting for orders.
A squadron of supersonic
fighters hung menacingly above.</p>

<p>The behavior of birds varied
considerably. Most fled or gave the
loaves a wide berth, but some
bolder species, discovering the minimal
nutritive nature of the translucent
brown objects, attacked
them furiously with beaks and
claws. Hydrogen diffusing slowly
through the crusts had now distended
most of the sealed plastic
wrappers into little balloons, which
ruptured, when pierced, with disconcerting
<i>pops</i>.</p>

<p>Below, neck-craning citizens
crowded streets and back yards,
cranks and cultists had a field day,
while local and national governments
raged indiscriminately at
Puffyloaf and at each other.</p>

<p>Rumors that a fusion weapon
would be exploded in the midst of
the flying bread drew angry protests
from conservationists and a flood
of telefax pamphlets titled "H-Loaf
or H-bomb?"</p>

<p>Stockholm sent a mystifying
note of praise to the United Nations
Food Organization.</p>

<p>Delhi issued nervous denials of a
millet blight that no one had heard
of until that moment and reaffirmed
India's ability to feed her
population with no outside help
except the usual.</p>

<p>Radio Moscow asserted that the
Kremlin would brook no interference
in its treatment of the Ukrainians,
jokingly referred to the flying
bread as a farce perpetrated by
mad internationalists inhabiting
Cloud Cuckoo Land, added contradictory
references to airborne
bread booby-trapped by Capitalist
gangsters, and then fell moodily
silent on the whole topic.</p>

<p>Radio Venus reported to its
winged audience that Earth's
inhabitants were establishing food
depots in the upper air, preparatory
to taking up permanent aerial
residence "such as we have always
enjoyed on Venus."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">NEWNEW YORK made feverish
preparations for the passage
of the flying bread. Tickets
for sightseeing space in skyscrapers
were sold at high prices; cold meats
and potted spreads were hawked to
viewers with the assurance that
they would be able to snag the
bread out of the air and enjoy a
historic sandwich.</p>

<p>Phineas T. Gryce, escaping from
his own managerial suite, raged
about the city, demanding general
cooperation in the stretching of
great nets between the skyscrapers
to trap the errant loaves. He was
captured by Tin Philosopher, escaped
again, and was found posted
with oxygen mask and submachine gun
on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf
Tower, apparently determined
to shoot down the loaves as they
appeared and before they involved
his company in more trouble with
Customs and the State Department.</p>

<p>Recaptured by Tin Philosopher,
who suffered only minor bullet
holes, he was given a series of mild
electroshocks and returned to the
conference table, calm and clear-headed
as ever.</p>

</div>

<p>But the bread flight, swinging
away from a hurricane moving up
the Atlantic coast, crossed a
clouded-in Boston by night and
disappeared into a high Atlantic
overcast, also thereby evading a
local storm generated by the
Weather Department in a last-minute
effort to bring down or at
least disperse the H-loaves.</p>

<p>Warnings and counterwarnings
by Communist and Capitalist governments
seriously interfered with
military trailing of the flight during
this period and it was actually
lost in touch with for several days.</p>

<p>At scattered points, seagulls were
observed fighting over individual
loaves floating down from the gray
roof&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>A mood of spirituality strongly
tinged with humor seized the people
of the world. Ministers sermonized
about the bread, variously
interpreting it as a call to charity,
a warning against gluttony, a parable
of the evanescence of all
earthly things, and a divine joke.
Husbands and wives, facing each
other across their walls of breakfast
toast, burst into laughter. The
mere sight of a loaf of bread anywhere
was enough to evoke guffaws.
An obscure sect, having as
part of its creed the injunction
"Don't take yourself so damn seriously,"
won new adherents.</p>

<p>The bread flight, rising above an
Atlantic storm widely reported to
have destroyed it, passed unobserved
across a foggy England and
rose out of the overcast only over
Mittel-europa. The loaves had at
last reached their maximum altitude.</p>

<p>The Sun's rays beat through the
rarified air on the distended plastic
wrappers, increasing still further
the pressure of the confined hydrogen.
They burst by the millions
and tens of millions. A high-flying
Bulgarian evangelist, who had happened
to mistake the up-lever for
the east-lever in the cockpit of his
flier and who was the sole witness
of the event, afterward described it
as "the foaming of a sea of diamonds,
the crackle of God's
knuckles."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">BY THE millions and tens of
millions, the loaves coasted
down into the starving Ukraine.
Shaken by a week of humor that
threatened to invade even its own
grim precincts, the Kremlin made
a sudden about-face. A new policy
was instituted of communal ownership
of the produce of communal
farms, and teams of hunger-fighters
and caravans of trucks loaded with
pumpernickel were dispatched into
the Ukraine.</p>

<p>World distribution was given to
a series of photographs showing
peasants queueing up to trade scavenged
Puffyloaves for traditional
black bread, recently aerated itself
but still extra solid by comparison,
the rate of exchange demanded by
the Moscow teams being twenty
Puffyloaves to one of pumpernickel.</p>

<p>Another series of photographs,
picturing chubby workers' children
being blown to bits by booby-trapped
bread, was quietly destroyed.</p>

<p>Congratulatory notes were exchanged
by various national governments
and world organizations,
including the Brotherhood of Free
Business Machines. The great
bread flight was over, though for
several weeks afterward scattered
falls of loaves occurred, giving rise
to a new folklore of manna among
lonely Arabian tribesmen, and in
one well-authenticated instance in
Tibet, sustaining life in a party of
mountaineers cut off by a snow
slide.</p>

<p>Back in NewNew York, the
managerial board of Puffy Products
slumped in utter collapse
around the conference table, the
long crisis session at last ended.
Empty coffee cartons were scattered
around the chairs of the three
humans, dead batteries around
those of the two machines. For a
while, there was no movement
whatsoever. Then Roger Snedden
reached out wearily for the earphones
where Megera Winterly
had hurled them down, adjusted
them to his head, pushed a button
and listened apathetically.</p>

<p>After a bit, his gaze brightened.
He pushed more buttons and listened
more eagerly. Soon he was
sitting tensely upright on his stool,
eyes bright and lower face all
a-smile, muttering terse comments
and questions into the lapel mike
torn from Meg's fair neck.</p>

<p>The others, reviving, watched
him, at first dully, then with quickening
interest, especially when he
jerked off the earphones with a
happy shout and sprang to his feet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">"LISTEN to this!" he cried in
a ringing voice. "As a result
of the worldwide publicity, Puffyloaves
are outselling Fairy Bread
three to one&mdash;and that's just the
old carbon-dioxide stock from our
freezers! It's almost exhausted, but
the government, now that the
Ukrainian crisis is over, has taken
the ban off helium and will also
sell us stockpiled wheat if we need
it. We can have our walking mills
burrowing into the wheat caves in
a matter of hours!</p>

<p>"But that isn't all! The far
greater demand everywhere is for
Puffyloaves that will actually float.
Public Relations, Child Liaison
Division, reports that the kiddies
are making their mothers' lives
miserable about it. If only we can
figure out some way to make
hydrogen non-explosive or the
helium loaf float just a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can take care of
that quite handily," Tin Philosopher
interrupted briskly. "Puffyloaf
has kept it a corporation secret&mdash;even
you've never been told
about it&mdash;but just before he went
crazy, Everett Whitehead discovered
a way to make bread using
only half as much flour as we do in
the present loaf. Using this secret
technique, which we've been saving
for just such an emergency, it will
be possible to bake a helium loaf as
buoyant in every respect as the
hydrogen loaf."</p>

<p>"Good!" Roger cried. "We'll
tether 'em on strings and sell 'em
like balloons. No mother-child
shopping team will leave the store
without a cluster. Buying bread
balloons will be the big event of
the day for kiddies. It'll make the
carry-home shopping load lighter
too! I'll issue orders at once&mdash;"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">HE broke off, looking at Phineas
T. Gryce, said with quiet
assurance, "Excuse me, sir, if I
seem to be taking too much upon
myself."</p>

<p>"Not at all, son; go straight
ahead," the great manager said approvingly.
"You're"&mdash;he laughed
in anticipation of getting off a
memorable remark&mdash;"rising to the
challenging situation like a genuine
Puffyloaf."</p>

<p>Megera Winterly looked from
the older man to the younger.
Then in a single leap she was upon
Roger, her arms wrapped tightly
around him.</p>

<p>"My sweet little ever-victorious,
self-propelled monkey wrench!" she
crooned in his ear. Roger looked
fatuously over her soft shoulder at
Tin Philosopher who, as if moved
by some similar feeling, reached
over and touched claws with Rose
Thinker.</p>

<p>This, however, was what he telegraphed
silently to his fellow machine
across the circuit so completed:</p>

<p>"Good-o, Rosie! That makes another
victory for robot-engineered
world unity, though you almost
gave us away at the start with that
'bread overhead' jingle. We've
struck another blow against the
next world war, in which&mdash;as we
know only too well!&mdash;we machines
would suffer the most. Now if we
can only arrange, say, a fur-famine
in Alaska and a migration of long-haired
Siberian lemmings across
Behring Straits ... we'd have to
swing the Japanese Current up
there so it'd be warm enough for
the little fellows.... Anyhow,
Rosie, with a spot of help from the
Brotherhood, those humans will
paint themselves into the peace
corner yet."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he and Rose Thinker
quietly watched the Blonde Icicle
melt.</p>
